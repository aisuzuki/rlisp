# Lisp interpreter in Rust

Practice Rust by implementing an interpreter.

## todo
- [x] implement read
- [ ] implement eval (with some native opcode)
- [ ] implement print
- [ ] implement garbage collector (Mark and Sweep?)
- [ ] implement function table
- [ ] implement defun

Ask code review (tbd)
* avoid nested pattern matching (how?)
* sufficient test cases
* research garbage collections (other than MnS)
